#### Triangle Type Detector Website, Monday, 3rd December 2018
#### By **Loise Mwangi**

## Description
tri-pi (Triangle Private Investigator) is a fun website with a user-friendly, interface that determines the type of triangle based on side lengths. It deviates from a typical calculator by engaging the user through a simulated game-like environment that makes it both fun and informative.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Web browser
* Adobe Flash Player

## Behavior Driven Development BDD
### Who is the target User?
* Mainly School kids exploring shapes and geometry and curious adults.

### Front-end/User Interface Logic Objectives

* Get user input (length a, length b, length c (with predictive placeholder input text box).
* Display answer(with an image and name of the triangle.)

### Back-end/Business logic Objectives
* get input from user (length a, length b, length c - pre-defined).
* make input button active.
* evaluate properties of the 4 scenarios
* create functions and arrays
* give answer/output.

### Test 01 (A triangle?)
The sum of two sides has to greater than the 3rd.
a + b <= c
b + c <= a
c + a <= b

### Test 02 (An equilateral triangle?)
a === b or b === c or a === c

### Test 03 (An isosceles triangle?)
a === b || b === c || c === a

### Test 03 (A scalene triangle?)
a !== b and b !== c and a !== c
